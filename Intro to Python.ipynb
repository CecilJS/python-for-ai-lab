Let's consider why this matters, and how imperative programming relates to the code block we just executed above.\n",

Imperative languages are based on statements, and those statements determine the [flow of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) within a program. A statement that controls something? That probably sounds familiar, often we call these **instructions**, you can think of statements as instructions or micro instructions if you like. All actions within an imperative program are caused by, and only only occure because of, a given statement which produced the action. In other words, the program is strictly controlled by instructions.\n",

We said that Python is an object-oriented programming language, and while not the case for all such languages, [all data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#data-model).

This means that the expression is evaluated once, when the function is defined, and that the same “pre-computed” value is used for each call. This is especially important to understand when a default parameter is a mutable object, such as a list or a dictionary: if the function modifies the object (e.g. by appending an item to a list), the default value is in effect modified. This is generally not what was intended. A way around this is to use None as the default, and explicitly test for it in the body of the function.\n",
