Let's consider why this matters, and how imperative programming relates to the code block we just executed above.\n",

Imperative languages are based on statements, and those statements determine the [flow of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) within a program. A statement that controls something? That probably sounds familiar, often we call these **instructions**, you can think of statements as instructions or micro instructions if you like. All actions within an imperative program are caused by, and only only occure because of, a given statement which produced the action. In other words, the program is strictly controlled by instructions.\n",

    "These built-in types are often _refered to_ as [primitive data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type). You are encouraged to read more about these types of data. However, as you may have noticed in the Python documentation, the concept of true primatives does not really exist in Python, in fact, technically speaking, primatives are not even a feature of the Python programming language. We said that Python is an object-oriented programming language, and while not the case for all such languages, [all data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#data-model).

This means that the expression is evaluated once, when the function is defined, and that the same “pre-computed” value is used for each call. This is especially important to understand when a default parameter is a mutable object, such as a list or a dictionary: if the function modifies the object (e.g. by appending an item to a list), the default value is in effect modified. This is generally not what was intended. A way around this is to use None as the default, and explicitly test for it in the body of the function.\n",
