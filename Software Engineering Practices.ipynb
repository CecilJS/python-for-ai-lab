    "## 1. Introduction to software engineering practices\n",
    "\n",
    "You will often hear of different software engineering 'practices' in the workplace. Professionals are expected to be able to apply _widely accepted practices_ which improve the overall quality of a team or project. This is critical because your _personally preferred practices_ may differ from what others prefer. Professional software engineering, especially when working on a team, requires a level of consistency and quality. Therefore, some practices will likely need to be applied across an entire project or team so that you might meet your target metrics. Of course, many professionals, teams, and even organizations have already experimented with different practices; this is where the idea of [_'best practices'_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice) comes in to play. These are practices that have proven to be effective across projects, teams, and organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "_'Practice'_ is usually in reference to the above mentioned practice of applying 'the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software.' For instance, one practice may pertain to the general efficiency and modularity of code, while another practice may pertain to a specific nuance of [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one programmer may prefer the development practice of using the shortest possible names (consider the function name `get_doc_el()`) while others may prefer using unabbreviated names (consider the equivalent function name `get_document_element()`). Yet, either practice is often inconsequential as long as the over all _'best practice'_ of using _clear, specific, meaningful names_ is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when a professional suggests a _'best practice'_, it is almost always a practice that is _widely considered superior than alternative practices_ and not merely a personal preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider our development practice relating to naming above, an inferior practice would be to use broad, confusing, or meaningless names such as `get_the_dat()` which uses a lot of characters to communicates very little information."

    "Generally, senior professionals expected to understand _**why**_ a practice is best and _**how**_ to tweak a practice to better fit a team or project, while more junior professionals are expected to know _**what**_ best practices to use in a given environment. The software engineering community as a whole is in agreement concerning most honest _'best practice'_ without much dissent.\n",
