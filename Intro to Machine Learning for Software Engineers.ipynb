    "## 1. Introduction to [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Machine learning is the study of computer [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a part of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as '[training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#training_set)', in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as [email filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering) and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the goal of machine learning? Typically we are looking to train an algorithm so that it produces useful output from a given input. Take traditional programming for instance. The following input: `4`, passed to the following Python algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def cube(x):\n",
    "    return x**3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Produces the following useful output: `64`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, one machine learning goal might be to take an input equal to an image of a horse, pass it to a function equal to a machine learning algorithm, and get an output equal to the same horse, but transformed into a zebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another goal might be to take an input equal to historical electricity consumption, pass it to a function equal to a machine learning algorithm, and get an output equal to the future year's electricity consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another goal might be to take an input equal to a physical structure's attributes (say, data about a given house: size, location, damage, etc.), pass it to a function equal to a machine learning algorithm, and get an output equal to the value of the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another goal might be to take an input equal to a set of geo-locations representing residences in a city, pass this set to a function which is equal to a machine learning algorithm, and get an output equal to a the bounded geo-locations grouped according to proximity.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do all these goals have in common? \n",
    "\n",
    "For one, they can all actually be represented by the same formula: `f(x) = y`. Where `x` and `y` are input and output data respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what about the function `f`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider again our traditional programming example, what would represent `f` in that case? Yes, the `cube` algorithm! In the same way, in machine learning, we are searching for the _algorithm `f`_. Of course, in traditional software development, we can simply design an algorithm ourselves. But how does this process work programmatically in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will consider two [types of machine learning algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Types_of_learning_algorithms) which are designed to accomplish just that; [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), and [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).

    "### 2.1 Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "> Supervised learning is the [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#training_set) consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a \"reasonable\" way (see [inductive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we have a set of 'correct answers' (often called `labels`) corresponding to true outputs: `y`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these `labels` do not necessarily correspond to all the possible outputs ever. Rather, they correspond to a decent set of outputs that allow an algorithm to generalize to a problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our previous formula: `f(x) = y`. If `y` is known during the training process, then we are dealing with a supervised learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm, `f`, is learned by training on input-output data pairs. Those inputs (often called `features`), therefore, must correspond to `x`, representing the input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we mean by _**training**_ anyway? We can again simplify the idea by considering traditional programming. Say you were tasked with building an algorithm that would calculate the _mean_ of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def calculate_mean(data):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Function to calculate the mean of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Args: \n",
    "        data: list. A list of int.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns: \n",
    "        mean: float. Mean of data.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you go about building such an algorithm? Ideally, if you already knew how to compute the mean of a list, you would simply implement the solution immediately, possibly as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def calculate_mean(data):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Function to calculate the mean of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Args: \n",
    "        data: list. A list of int.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns: \n",
    "        mean: float. Mean of data.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return sum(data) / len(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But say you did not know how to compute the mean of a list. Then what would you do? And what if you were in a void, with no access to outside material? You'd be in a tough situation!\n",
    "\n",
    "But say someone gave you one-thousand input-output pairs, each demonstrating an input represented by a list of integers, and an output represented by the true mean of that list. Now what would you do? Indeed, trial and error. Possibly, you could start with a simple algorithm, your best guess, and test the product of your algorithm against your set of true means. When your outputs are far off from the truth, you make large changes to your algorithm, and when your outputs are close to the truth, you make smaller changes. With each iteration drawing you closer and closer to the true solution.\n",

    "In the same way, machine learning algorithms are learned by iterating over many input-output pairs with the goal of training the algorithm to output values equal to the true outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Unsupervised learning (UL) is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world. In contrast to Supervised Learning (SL) where data is tagged by a human, eg. as \"car\" or \"fish\" etc, UL exhibits self-organization that captures patterns as neuronal predilections or probability densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that, while sharing certain attributes, supervised and unsupervised learning are not equal. For one, unsupervised learning has _no true outputs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider our formula: `f(x) = y`. It is evident that unsupervised learning problems dictate that, while `y` exists, it cannot be derived from input-output pairs. In other words, while we have `features`, we _do not_ have `labels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the way in which the algorithm `f` is learned is no longer by training on `x` and `y` pairs as in supervised learning. Rather, we are now attempting to learn an optimal _pattern_ directly from the input `x` itself.\n",
    "\n",

Each connection, like the [synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The \"signal\" at a connection is a [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number), and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting) that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
